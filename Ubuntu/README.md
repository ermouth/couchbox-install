# Couchbox install for Ubuntu 14+

This set of scripts installs and starts CouchDB 1.6.1, Redis, nginx, nodejs, UFW 
and Couchbox over clean Ubuntu. 

You can a) clone this repo, or 
b) download  [archive.tar](https://gitlab.com/Couchbox/install/repository/archive.tar?ref=master) 
into temp folder and unpack it. All stuff is located at `install/Ubuntu`.

To configure, check/edit `config.sh` script, then if necessary `nginx.conf` and `couchbox.json`.
To run install type `sudo sh install.sh`. 

Scripts will download all dependencies and components, then install and start them.
Also scripts will configure all required autostarts. 

Installation takes 5â€“10 minutes normally. Fast internet connection and at least 
2Gb of RAM required (npm is hungry, sorry).

After install finishes, check `http://localhost/index`. It must return `{ text: 'Welcome to Couchbox!' }` 
json.

## Preconfigure

#### config.sh

Follow comments inside the script. Uncomment log-related lines to have log in CouchDB 
bucket (may be useful for multinode log aggregation).

#### nginx.conf

Re-configure nginx to set up SSL and bind a domain. Set up matching rules for paths 
routed to couchbox.

#### couchbox.json

Set up CORS, emergency notification email address (`couchbox.mail` section), nodename
and plugins config.

## CVE-2017-12635 note

Since Couchbox installs CouchDB 1.6.1, which has serious vulnerability, you may use
[special recipe](http://bit.ly/2mRUt37), patching the hole.
